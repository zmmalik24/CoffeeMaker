# CoffeeMaker-NCSU

Developed as part of the software engineering program at North Carolina State University. Key concepts utilized: REST APIS, frontend development, backend development. 

Languages: Java, AngularJS, HTTP, JSON. 

NOTE: this was not done entirely by me. I worked on an agile team to accomplish this. While I contributed to every part and developed parts of the frontend, backend, and the REST APIs, I did not do all of it and it was done in pair programming.
